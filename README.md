Methods (Sensitivity exposure).
“Our primary exposure was palliative care consultation identified by any-listed ICD-10-CM Z51.5. Because Z51.5 may undercapture palliative/hospice involvement, we prespecified a hospice-inclusive sensitivity definition: exposed if Z51.5 was present or if the patient was a live discharge to home health care (DISPUNIFORM=6 with DIED=0). This approach follows HCUP’s recoding in which hospice-home is contained within the Home Health Care category, while restricting to live discharges preserves face validity.”

Results (framing the higher rate).
“Using the hospice-inclusive definition increased the exposure prevalence from ~5% to ~28%, which is expected because Home Health Care includes both hospice-home and non-hospice services. Despite the higher prevalence, adjusted associations for key predictors were directionally consistent with the Z51.5-only analysis.”

Discussion (why this is acceptable).
“This sensitivity analysis is intentionally liberal and should be interpreted as an upper bound for serious-illness care capture in the NIS. The definition aligns with how HCUP maps hospice-home into Home Health Care while our live-discharge restriction avoids conflating in-hospital death with hospice placement. The stability of effect estimates across the primary and sensitivity definitions supports the robustness of our findings.”

Limitations (one line).
“Because Home Health Care also encompasses non-hospice services, misclassification toward overinclusion is possible. We therefore present this definition as a secondary, hospice-inclusive sensitivity rather than our primary exposure.”
