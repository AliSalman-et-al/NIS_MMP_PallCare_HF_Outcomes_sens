Methods (sensitivity exposure).
Our primary exposure was palliative care consultation identified by any-listed ICD-10-CM Z51.5. Because Z51.5 may under-capture palliative/hospice involvement, we conducted a hospice-inclusive sensitivity definition: exposed if Z51.5 was present or if the patient was a live discharge to home health care (DISPUNIFORM=6 with DIED=0). This leverages HCUP’s mapping in which hospice-home is contained within the Home Health Care category and avoids conflating in-hospital death with hospice placement.

Results (sensitivity).
Using the hospice-inclusive definition, exposure prevalence increased from 5.1% to 28.8%. Predictors shifted in clinically coherent ways for services tied to discharge planning and community-based care—higher odds with Medicare coverage, the Northeast region, and urban teaching hospitals—and modestly higher odds among Black patients. These patterns contrast with the Z51.5-only model, which more specifically reflects specialty palliative consultation.

Interpretation.
Rather than a contradiction, the sensitivity analysis provides a complementary lens on serious-illness care during HF hospitalization. Z51.5 isolates documented specialty consultation; the hospice-inclusive composite captures a broader ecosystem of end-of-life–oriented services and transitions to community care. The divergence in estimates highlights where disparities likely arise from consultation practices versus discharge pathways and access to home-based services. Taken together, the two definitions triangulate the burden and distribution of serious-illness care, strengthening the robustness and policy relevance of our findings.
